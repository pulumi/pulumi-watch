# watchutil-rs

This repo builds a utility program `pulumi-watch` to support the functionality of the [`pulumi watch`
command](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/reference/cli/pulumi_watch/).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, however the utility must conform to the argument specifications or interfaces required by the [Pulumi CLI](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi).

## Attribution

This library uses the [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec) library to implement recursive file watching.
Credit to Matt Green and FÃ©lix Saparelli for their performant, cross-platform file watching utility.

# Testing
